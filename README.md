My name is Ryan Nasers and I'm senior/junior in Aerospace!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Eagle Eye.  We're working on creating an active stabilization system for better data collection at altitude.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Compressible flows, structures, computer science, flight dynamics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various reserach projects within the computerscience and aerospace world.
- I really enjoy working on anything that has computer science in it, I do some small side projects with coding basic games too.  Right now some friends and I are working on building a very lightweight RTS game.
- Hobbies include gaming, reading, biking, game modding and coding, and good foods.
